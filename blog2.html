        Though I am a product of my parents biologically, it was my choices that built me mentally, spiritually, and emotionally.
From a bully to a healer, from a scapegoat to acquiring accountability, from emotional to rational, from a people pleaser to seeking validation only internally, I’ve sculpted the Bhagyashree Karale I am today. Throughout these changes, I’ve become infatuated with the word ‘choice’.
‘Choice’ is defined as an act of choosing between two or more possibilities. Yet for me, choices are the mirroring of one’s holistic personality.
It is our choices that define us far more than our abilities. I can enforce peace or pain in someone’s life, I could choose to follow the unconventional or the traditional dictates; Ultimately, I am what I choose.
Today, instead of pursuing computer science from any other ordinary college, I choose to challenge myself with the rigorous curriculum at Ashoka and grow distinctively.
