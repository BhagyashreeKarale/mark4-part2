        Choosing growth over comfort by opting for NavGurukul after a major mental breakdown was one of my bravest decisions. Though I felt like giving up, my fortitude kept me steady. After getting involved in the community, I finally felt at home. I had discovered a new point of view that taking risks was the optimal way to grow a change. With this realization, the grass became greener than it had ever seemed and I became a horse freely cantering around a vast open meadow.
NG taught me an extremely important lesson: you will only get out of life as much as you put into it. Stepping out of my comfort zone allowed me to not only discover an interest in programming but also rebuild myself. It implored me to trace my sidelined passion for community engagement. Living in NavGurukul reminded me of the importance of giving back to the community.
